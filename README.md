Tic Tac Toe
---
In this project I created a basic tic tac toe game incorporating factory functions and module pattern. This was the most difficult project so far and I had great difficulty of writing code freely without the usage of global variables.

There was a small bug where making a winning move on the last turn resulted in a tie. This was fixed by switching the order of checkTie()/checkWin() since the tie check overrode the win condition.
