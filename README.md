Tic Tac Toe
---
In this project I created a basic tic tac toe game incorporating factory functions and module pattern. This was the most difficult project so far and I had great difficulty of writing code freely since global variables were not allowed.

There is currently a small bug where the game results in a tie when player 1 makes a winning move on the last turn.
